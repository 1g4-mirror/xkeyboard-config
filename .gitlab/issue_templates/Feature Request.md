# Description

# Rationale for the inclusion in this project

<!--
# Request for addition of a new layout or other feature

As a general rule, we accept layouts that are part of official standards but
not experimental layouts.

For any feature, please provide evidences that it is popular enough to make sense
to include by default in every system that use xkeyboard-config. Please note that
it is in your interest to provide neutral and accessible sources, if possible in
English.
